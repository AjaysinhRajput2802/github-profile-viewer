# [GitHub Profile Viewer](https://heroic-halva-2ab300.netlify.app/)

This project is developed in ReactJS to show a Github repositories listing page by passing the required Github username. I have used GitHub REST API here.

## Assumptions
1. Only two types of error occur: 
    1. API rate limit(60 requests per hour) exceeded.
    2. Invalid Username
  
## Run on local machine in Development Mode

#### Copy and paste below script in terminal to run the web application :)
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/AjaysinhRajput2802/github-profile-viewer.git
$ cd github-profile-viewer
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
